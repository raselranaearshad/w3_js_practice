# JavaScript String
* Strings are for **storing text**
* Strings are written **with quotes`""`or `''`**
```js
let text = "John Doe";
```
## Template Strings
* Templates were introduced with ES6 (JavaScript 2016).
* Templates are strings enclosed in backticks (`This is a template string`).
* Templates allow single and double quotes inside a string.
```js
let text = `He's ofen called "Jony"`;
```
> Templates are not supported in Internet Explorer.
## String Length
To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property:
```js
let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
let length = text.length;
```
