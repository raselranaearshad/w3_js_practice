# JavaScript Assignment Operator
Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript Variables.
|Operator|Example|Same As|
|--------|-------|-------|
|=|x = y|x = y|
|+=|x += y|x = x + y|
|-=|x -= y|x = x - y|
|*=|x *= y|x = x * y|
|/=|x /= y|x = x / y|
|%=|x %= y|x = x % y|
|**=|x **= y|x = x ** y|

## Shift Assignment Operator
|Operator|Example|Same As|
|--------|-------|-------|
|<<=|x <<= y|x = x << y|
|>>=|x >>= y|x = x >> y|
|>>>=|x >>>= y|x = x >>>= y|

## Bitwise Assignment Operator
|Operator|Example|Same As|
|--------|-------|-------|
|&=|x &= y|x = x & y|
|^=|x ^= y|x = x ^ y|

## Bitwise Assignment Operator
|Operator|Example|Same As|
|--------|-------|-------|
|&&=|x &&= y|x = x && (x = y)|
|??=|x ??= y|x = x ?? (x = y)|

### The &&= Operator
* The **Logical AND Assignment Operator** is used between two values.
* If the first value is true, the second value is assigned.
### The ||= Operator
* The **Logical OR Assignment Operator** is used between two values.
* If the first value is false, the second value is assigned.
### The ??= Operator
* The **Nullish Coalescing Assignment** operator is used between two values.
* If the first value is undefined or null, the second value is assigned.
