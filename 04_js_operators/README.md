## Types of JavaScript Operators
There are different types of JavaScript Operators:
* Arithmetic Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Comparison Operators

### JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
**Arithmetic Operators** are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

Example:
```js
let a = 3;
let x = (100 + 50) * a;
```
### JavaScript Assignment Operators
The **Assignment Operator** ```=``` assigns a value to a variable:
```js
// Assign the value 5 to x
let x = 5;
// Assign the value 2 to y
let y = 2;
// Assign the value x + y to z:
let z = x + y;
```
